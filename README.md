# ðŸ§  Single-Cell-Synaptic-Clustering

This repository contains code and analysis from my Master's thesis project in computational neuroscience. The project investigates how **dendritic calcium-mediated action potentials (dCaAPs)** influence **synaptic clustering** in a simulated single cell.

---

## ðŸ§© Project Summary

The simulation includes:
- A **compartmental neuron** with active dendritic compartments
- A network of **point neurons** simulating the input cell assemblies

The goal was to study how **dCaAPs enhance dendritic computation** and support **input clustering** and **memory stability**, in comparison to NMDA spikes.

Key components:
- Modeling of somatic and dendritic spiking
- Simulating structural and functional plasticity and Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP)
- Analysis of synaptic input clustering
- Comparison of different learning mechanisms
